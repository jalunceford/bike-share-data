The selected Capital One Mindsumo Challenge competitors were given a data set and a set of questions to answer about the dataset. I provided answers to the questions by performing data analysis through Python.
First, visit the following url to see the deliverables, or questions that I solved.
With that, check out my jupyter notebook file to have a look at the code and comments that answer the questions! The finalists of the competition secure a spot at the Capital One Software Engineering Summit!
